## Design :
#### Virtual:
###### Attached are the designs that we envision to create

#### Desktop:

##### The Layout is so that the contents fit in desktop browsers and is organized to that extent

#### Mobile: 
###### The Logo and the name is not parallel due to the limit of the visual space available in mobile browsers. Instead it appears like a list
###### The Layout is very different and everything appears more on top of another function
