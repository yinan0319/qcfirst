## Design :
#### Virtual:
###### Attached are the designs that we envision to create 
#### Responsiveness:
#### Desktop:
###### The Logo and the name is parallel to each other on the top
##### The Layout is so that the contents fit in desktop browsers and is organized to that extent
#### Tablet: 
###### The Logo and the name is also parallel to each other at the top
##### The Layout is somewhat similar to that of the desktop , except it is in an eight column space and the visual is a tad bit different
#### Mobile: 
###### The Logo and the name is not parallel due to the limit of the visual space available in mobile browsers. Instead it appears like a list
###### The Layout is very different and everything appears more on top of another function
